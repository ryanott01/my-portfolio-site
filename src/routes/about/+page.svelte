		<p class="md:text-xl opacity-75">
			I attended <a class="anchor" href="https://devmountain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Devmountain's</a> 36 week program in Python Software engineering.
		</p>
		<p class="md:text-xl opacity-75">
			As a Full-Stack Developer with a foundation in IT and web management, I've built server-side solutions using Node.js, Django, and Flask, and explored front-end development with Svelte (like this website). My experience extends to SQL databases, RESTful APIs, and OAuth implementation.
		</p>
		<p class="md:text-xl opacity-75">
			I started my career at GingerSec, focusing on a range of IT projects, from network infrastructure to Windows deployment in healthcare environments. I then moved to Charter One, where I transitioned from being an IT Coordinator overseeing multiple schools, to a Web Technician managing and optimizing websites across several districts.
		</p>
		<p class="md:text-xl opacity-75">
			About a year ago, my career took a new direction when I Started DevMountain's coding bootcamp. The program ignited a passion for coding and prompted me to seek a development role. I've been honing my coding skills ever since and am eager for a career pivot into software development.
		</p>
		<p class="md:text-xl opacity-75">
			In summary, my diverse IT background and recent coding education have prepared me for a future role as a specialized developer. I'm enthusiastic about mastering the art and science of software development as my long-term career path.
